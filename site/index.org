Hi, I'm Bart. I started programming at age 11 with nothing but QuickBASIC and
the help file. Since then I've dabbled in C, C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, Swift,
Ruby, Python, Javascript, OCaml, Common Lisp, Elixir, Racket and F#.

I've competed in ICPC contests. I love to gather and share knowledge and always
wants to talk to anyone who wants to listen. I am always exploring new ways to
improve software development practices and the resulting software solutions.

<h1 class="title">How I Learned To Let Go And Ship It</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Mar 26, 2021</p>
</header><p>
In early February I decided that maybe I should start a Jekyll based website,
hosted on GitHub Pages. Almost two months later, this is the first <i>real</i> post.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgcef4682" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcef4682">Humble beginnings</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcef4682">
<p>
It starts simple. You think "I know, I'll start a website!" You decide on tech,
hack together or search for a simple theme and publish. "There!" you think,
"We're up!"
</p>

<p>
This is exactly what I did. The initial one line post is still here. But then it
begins. There a <i>ton</i> of stuff I still wanted to do. In the end this resulted in
not doing anything for far too long. Not that I didn't <i>do</i> anything. I did
plenty. But for a long time nobody could see it but me. And I was not producing
any content.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0f3fda" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb0f3fda">So much to do</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0f3fda">
<p>
So what did I want to do? I wanted a better theme. I quickly noticed that even
though it's not hard to set up Jekyll locally, things work different between
local and GitHub Pages, so I wanted a staging environment.
</p>

<p>
I wanted my staging environment to be on a subdomain. But not indexed on
Google. So I had to get <code>robots.txt</code> working.
</p>

<p>
I wanted a workflow that reflected this. A workflow where I'd go from a
<code>staging</code> repository to a <code>main</code> repository, without affecting the drafts or
posts.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of drafts, I also wanted drafts to not be in a public GitHub
repository, but still be on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
I was, and still am, constantly debating if I want only an apex domain, only a
<code>www</code> subdomain, or both.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to develop locally without 'infecting' my system with Ruby. It's not
that I have anything agaist Ruby, but I have a million different little projects
in a million different (versions of) languages. I don't want all these to
clutter my machines.
</p>

<p>
I want analytics. Nothing fancy. Preferably not Google. Really all I want is
page views. If I were hosting this thing myself then I'd just grep the logs. But
it's on GitHub Pages, so I'm going to have to go with a Javascript based
solution.
</p>

<p>
I want categories. I want <i>see also</i>. I want series of posts. I want comments. I
want an RSS feed. Perhaps I should do something about SEO.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I want posts in a subdirectory so that it's better for future permalinks.
</p>

<p>
And I wanted content. I wanted content ready <i>before</i> going live for real. So
that I could schedule that.
</p>

<p>
That's a lot of things to do while also maintaining a full time job and a
life. Despite COVID-19, I don't have <i>that</i> much free time. And to be fair, it
started to look like work instead of fun. And that's how two months pass.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc950210" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc950210">So now that all of this is done</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc950210">
<p>
It isn't. Not nearly. But we're two months in and I want this thing live. So
here we go. It's shipped.
</p>

<p>
I'm using a remote theme. It's okay if that breaks during development. I can see
that locally. So I don't need a staging environment or a convoluted workflow.
</p>

<p>
I no longer really care about drafts. If there are any and someone sees them,
then so be it.
</p>

<p>
I use <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a> to keep my installation clean. I'm not yet sure how happy I am with
it, but it's interesting to play with nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
And now here we are. It's live. There's still plenty of things to do. Now that
I've shipped, content comes first. And all those other things? They'll
come. Shipping 10% of the things you want is a lot better than never shipping at
all.

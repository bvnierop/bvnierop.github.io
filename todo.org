* Theme
** Overhaul
Maybe I /do/ like the current look & feel. No redesign yet. Of course, I already
redesigned.

I don't really like the current look & feel. So I want to make something
different. But going live first is important, so I can redesign this later.
*** TODO Redesign
Probably base on https://nicolas.petton.fr/

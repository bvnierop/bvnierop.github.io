#+TODO: TODO(t) DOING(n) | DONE(d)

* Technical
** TODO Run deploy on a cron job
Nightly at 5 pm? Needed for the killer feature where I want to be able to set a
release date in the future and not publish future posts.

** TODO Don't publish posts with a date in the future
This way, if something is no longer a draft, but I don't want to release it yet,
I can! It's a way to set up a sort of schedule.

Which reminds me...

*** TODO Filter posts by DRAFT state AND date
*** TODO Write script to generate release schedule

** TODO Fork dependencies
** TODO Self-host css [#C]
I kind of want to replace the footer with just a copyright notice.
** DONE Favicon
* Functional
** DONE Staging [#A]
*** DONE Differ between staging / production CNAME
*** DONE Set up url
*** DONE Add Robots.txt [#A]
I only care about robots.txt for staging.
** DONE Analytics [#A]
** DONE Publish script [#A]
Simple steps:
- Run build script
- Copy output folder to git repo on the right branch
- Publish
** TODO Add tag support [#C]

** TODO Link paths without .html without index.html [#B]
** DONE Footer [#A]
** DONE Paths without .html [#A]
** DONE Add CNAME [#A]

* Posts
** TODO Cursor AI
** TODO GZipStream use
** TODO Base64UrlEncoding caveat
** TODO Something about Racket
** TODO Something about F#
** TODO Something about building your own Lisp
** TODO Levels of abstraction
I implemented a requirement several dozen levels deep in a call stack. It's nice
that it was one line there, but it also doesn't really belong that deep in logic.
